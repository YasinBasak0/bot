## Reference

### Incoming

You can listen to incoming event easily with Botpress by using `bp` built-in `hear` function. You only need to listen to specific Rocket.Chat event to be able to react to user's actions.

```js
bp.hear({platform:'rocketchat', type: 'message', text:'hello'}, async (event, next) => {
  await bp.rocketchat.sendMessage(event.channel, 'Hi I\'m alive', {})
  next()
})
```

In fact, this module preprocesses messages and send them to incoming middlewares. When you build a bot or a module, you can access to all information about incoming messages that have been send to  middlewares.

All your flow implementation will work with Rocket.Chat too.

```js
await bp.middlewares.sendIncoming({
    platform: 'rocketchat',
    type: 'message',
    text: message.msg,
    user: user,
    channel: message.rid,
    ts: message.ts.$date,
    direct: false,
    roomType: meta.roomType,
    raw: message
})
```

#### Profile

You can acces to all user's profile information by using this module. A cache have been implemented to fetch all information about users and this information is sent to middlewares.

```js
{
    id: id,
    userId: userId,
    username: message.u.username,
    platform: 'rocketchat',
    first_name: message.u.name,
    number: userId
}
```

**Note**: All new users are automatically saved by this module in Botpress built-in database (`bp.db`).

#### Text messages

An `event` is sent to middlewares for each incoming text message from Rocket.Chat platform with all specific information.

```js
{
    platform: 'rocketchat',
    type: 'message',
    text: message.msg,
    user: user,
    channel: message.rid,
    ts: message.ts.$date,
    direct: false,
    roomType: meta.roomType,
    raw: message
}
```

Then, you can listen easily to this `event` in your module or bot

```js
bp.hear('hello')
```

### Outgoing
